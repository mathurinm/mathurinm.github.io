I am a tenured researcher (*Chargé de recherche*) in Inria Lyon, in the OCKHAM team, working in Machine Learning. I am also a part-time lecturer (Professeur chargé de cours) at Ecole Polytechnique (Python for datasciences, statistics), and I teach in ENS de Lyon (machine and deep learning, optimization, optimal transport, generative models).

I have a keen interest in the Python programming language: I am the lead developer of [skglm](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm) (fast and flexible sklearn GLMs) and [celer](https://mathurinm.github.io/celer/) (fastest Lasso solver).
I am also a core developer of [benchopt](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a benchmarking framework that makes optimization benchmarks easy, transparent and reproducible.
<!-- To foster scientific reproducibility, my papers usually come with Python packages to reproduce my experiments and make my code available to the community (e.g. [Anderson acceleration for coordinate descent](https://mathurinm.github.io/andersoncd/auto_examples/index.html) or [Iterative regularization for convex regularizers](https://LCSL.github.io/iterreg/auto_examples/index.html)) -->

I am an Area Chair for NeurIPS and ICML, and an associate editor for TMLR; I was previously involved as associated editor for [Computo](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/), a journal promoting reproducibility through a novel publication format.

I co-organize the [Machine Learning and Signal Processing seminar](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/seminars/machine-learning-and-signal-processing) at ENS Lyon, send me a message if you want to present your work there!


**Short bio**: From January 2020 to October 2021, I was a post-doc at University of Genova, where I worked with [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and [Silvia Villa](http://www.dima.unige.it/~villa/) to develop new algorithms for implicit regularization.
I hold a PhD from Télécom Paris and Inria Saclay
([Parietal Team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/)), under the supervision of
    [Joseph Salmon](https://josephsalmon.eu/)
and [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/).
In my PhD, I improved the efficiency of brain signals reconstruction algorithms
(more details [here](http://www.theses.fr/s163051)), which involved optimization, sparsity and high dimensional statistics. I received the PGMO PhD prize for this work.
You can find more details on my résumé
    ([French (01/2021)](/assets/pdf/CV_Mathurin_MASSIAS.pdf), [English (09/2024)](/assets/pdf/CV_Mathurin_MASSIAS_EN.pdf)) and my
 [list of publications](/research).
