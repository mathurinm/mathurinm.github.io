I am a tenured researcher (Chargé de recherche) in Inria Lyon, in the OCKHAM team, working in optimization for Machine Learning. I am also a part-time lecturer (Professeur chargé de cours) at Ecole Polytechnique, and I teach in ENS de Lyon.

From January 2020 to October 2021, I was a post-doc at University of Genova, where I worked with [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and [Silvia Villa](http://www.dima.unige.it/~villa/) to develop new algorithms for implicit regularization.
I hold a PhD from Télécom Paris and Inria Saclay
([Parietal Team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/)), under the supervision of
    [Joseph Salmon](https://josephsalmon.eu/)
and [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/).
In my PhD, I improved the efficiency of brain signals reconstruction algorithms
(more details [here](http://www.theses.fr/s163051)), which involves optimization, sparsity and high dimensional statistics. I received the PGMO PhD prize for this work.

I have a keen interest in the Python programming language: I am the lead developer
of [celer](https://mathurinm.github.io/celer/) (fastest Lasso solver) and  [skglm](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm) (fast and flexible sklearn GLMs). I am also a core developer of [benchopt](https://github.com/benchopt/benchopt), a benchmarking framework that makes optimization benchmarks easy, transparent and reproducible.

To foster scientific reproducibility, my papers usually come with Python packages to reproduce my experiments and make my code available to the community (e.g. [Anderson acceleration for coordinate descent](https://mathurinm.github.io/andersoncd/auto_examples/index.html) or [Iterative regularization for convex regularizers](https://LCSL.github.io/iterreg/auto_examples/index.html))

I am an associate editor for [Computo](https://computo.sfds.asso.fr/), a journal promoting reproducibility through a novel publication format, and for TMLR; I am also an Area Chair for NeurIPS and ICML.


You can find more details on my résumé
    ([French (01/2021)](assets/pdf/CV_Mathurin_MASSIAS.pdf), [English (09/2024)](./assets/pdf/CV_Mathurin_MASSIAS_EN.pdf)) and my
 [list of publications](/research).


I co-organize the [Machine Learning and Signal Processing seminar](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/seminars/machine-learning-and-signal-processing) at ENS Lyon, send me a message if you want to present your work there!

## News
- I am happy to have joined the committee of SMAI's MODE group (optimization-related group of the French Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics).
- With Elsa Cazelles, Thomas Moreau, Aymeric Dieuleveut and Lorenzo Rosasco we organized LOL 2024 (Learning and optimization in Luminy) in CIRM. It was a blast, we are planning to hold the 4th edition in the first semester of 2026: stay tuned!
- We organized the SMAI MODE days in Lyon, from march 27th to march 29th. A minicourse on optimal transport by Gabriel Peyré and Yann Brenier was held at ENS de Lyon on the 25th and 26th.
- With Titouan Vayer and the help of GDR MIA we organized a thematic day on dimension reduction at ENS Lyon. The final planning is available [here](https://gdr-mia.math.cnrs.fr/events/dimreduc).
- Our paper on Coordinate descent for SLOPE was accepted to AISTATS'23! [Slides of the paper](./assets/pdf/slides_slope.pdf) presented at the Statistical Learning Seminar
- 2 papers accepted at Neurips'22, on benchopt and skglm.
- I gave a course on convex optimization at the [Computation and Modelling school](https://wmat.pwr.edu.pl/en/cm2022 ) in Wrocław; resources are on my teaching page.
- [celer 0.7](https://github.com/mathurinm/celer) is released, with a fast ElasticNet solver thanks to [Badr Moufad](https://github.com/Badr-MOUFAD )!
- We have integrated [skglm](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm) into scikit-learn, providing a customizable and accelerated solver for sparse GLMs in python.
