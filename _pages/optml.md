## Syllabus of the "Large scale optimization for machine and deep learning" class


The class studies the success of algorithms for large scale deep learning problems, covering both recent theoretical results as well as practical Python implementations of popular optimization algorithms.


## Syllabus
- basics of convex analysis: convex sets, convex functions, strong convexity, smoothness, subdifferential, Fenchel-Legendre transform, infimal convolution, Moreau envelope
- gradient descent and subgradient descent, fixed point iterations, proximal point method (Lab 1)
- acceleration of first order methods: Nesterov and momentum
- algorithms for Deep Learning: stochastic gradient descent, ADAM, Adagrad (Lab 2)
- automatic differentiation
- second order algorithms: Newton and quasi-Newton methods
- implicit regularization, duality, Bregman geometry, mirror descent
- recent results in non convex optimization
- other algorithms: Frank-Wolfe, primal-dual algorithms, extragradient.
