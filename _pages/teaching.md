### Classes taught

Summer schools:
- OLISSIPO Winter school: dimensionality reduction with Titouan Vayer (02/2023)
- Convex optimization @Computation and Modelling summer school, WUST 2022 ([intro slides](/assets/2022_wust/slides_intro.pdf) and [exercises](/assets/2022_wust/exos.pdf))

Since my arrival at ENS de Lyon (Nov. 2021):
- 10 h on Fundamentals of Machine Learning (2024-2025), M1 Level.
- 36 h on optimal transport (2024-2026), M2 level, with Titouan Vayer and Quentin Bertrand.
- 2x36 h on large scale optimization for machine and deep learning (2022-2024), M2 level.
- 12 h on optimization (2023-2024), M1 level.

I am a part-time teacher at Polytechnique, where I teach the Python for datascience class (42 h per year since 2019) in the X/HEC "Datascience for business" Master, using live coding  inspired by the Software Carpentry workshops. I designed the course from scratch, collaborating  with Joan Massich in 2019, Quentin Bertrand in 2020, Hicham Janati in 2021, Sylvain Combettes in 2022 and Badr Moufad in 2023.

Since 2020 I teach and handle practical sessions and data camps in Ecole Polytechnique's [Executive education](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/datascience/en/programs/data-science-starter-program-dssp).
Topics involved dimension reduction, clustering, scaling computations, visualization and datacamp. I designed 2 full python labs with Erwan Le Pennec on these topics.

<!-- From 2017 to 2019, as a grad student, my main teaching activity was the Optimization for datascience class of the [Datascience Master](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/mathematiques-et-applications/m2-data-sciences), totalling 2*40 h including 4 h as lecturer.
Amongst others, this involved refactoring of the practical sessions, tutoring of students during office hours, and partaking in the design of the final exam. -->
